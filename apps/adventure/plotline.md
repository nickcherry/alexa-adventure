#Book I

##Chapter 1
You awake in the cottage. You were knocked out and remember nothing.

##Chapter 2
You leave the cottage, and are ambushed by a group of theives on the way. You learn combat and go after the theif leader. At the end, there is a tunnel which leads to the underground theif city, but you can't go in.

##Chapter 3
You arrive in the town of Audia. You run an errand for the armorer, it's really easy. He asks you to clean his basement, which is filled with rats. It leads to the sewers, where there are snakes, and then a den of theives. You come back out and talk to the armorer, he brings you to the captain of the guard, who offers a reward for taking out the theives. You do it. 

##Chapter 4
After doing such great work with the theives, the captain of the guard asks you to deal with the brigands to the north. You defeat the brigands at the camp. In the leader's chest, you find a map which shows the location of another larger brigand camp and an orc camp. You've had your fill of fighting, and start to make your way back to town, but then see smoke. 

#Book II

##Chapter 5
You head towards the smoke and discover the cottage is burning, and the young girl who helped is screaming from inside the house, but you can't go inside. You couldn't save her. You are ambushed by an orc, and when you realize they killed this family that was helping you, you decide to go after their camp. You take out their camp. 

##Chapter 6
You can't go back to Audia and face her father. Sonica is pretty close, you decide to make your way there. You have to grind a few orcs & goblins to get there.

##Chapter 7
Sonica is an incredibly poor city, the hollow remnant of it's former glory. There are brigands who have been raiding the town, and there is almost no food. You need to get to a certain EXP level, but once you do, they recruit you to take out the brigands. Your reward for accepting the mission is a good sword and armor, plus more gold when you return. Taking out the brigands is hard, but you do it. You sleep. You dream. Of a dragon. A sonic dragon, who can scream a pitch so fierce it as if fire burns your brain... You wake up. No worries, just a dream.  

##Chapter 8
When you return, there are men from Aural, which is across the river at the base of Westfall. The people of Aural have been fighting the Sun Templars, that have come out of the desert. They need your help. Off you go. You defeat the templars, but then you are killed by a Sand Wizard (he's mad powerful, there is no way to win). 

#Book III

##Chapter 9
You wake up in a church in Aural, where a cleric tells you that in order to fight these wizards, you need ring of fire protection. Which is of course guarded by the elves. You travel to the Grandfather Maple, which is a tree the size of a city. You meet with the elves there who have been plagued by Dark Elves, which live in nearby cave. You do your shit. You get the Fire Ring. 

##Chapter 10
You head back to the desert, past the Templars, and fight the Sand Wizards, giant scorpions, Sand Serpents. You win. Nice job. 

##Chapter 11
In Aural, you head to a bar to celebrate. Perhaps there is an attractive whench that wants to.. but then you hear someone speaking of a fortune in rubies and emeralds. The bands of theives have become much more organized, and it is heard that the king wears a crown worth more than all of Mazaan (this is the island that includes Sonica and Audia, not Aural of course, which is across the river on the mainland). Hmm.. you actually know exactly where you can find an entrance to them (Back in Chapter 2). Off you go. 

##Chapter 12
You fight your way through the Underground Thief City. You make it into the Theif King's lair and fight him. But he has bombs. He throws them at you, and one causes a cave-in. You kill him, but you are trapped underground, the torches go out, it's just blackness.

#Book IV

##Chapter 13
You light a torch. You find the back exit. It leads out to a ruined city. You have flashbacks of your life. You remember this city. You are attacked by watermen. They have watermen Shaman, Big Lizards, Water Snakes. You earn the Water Ring. You learn about Portals, which are based on the rings you have. They let you access other map areas very easily. 

##Chapter 14
On the edge of the ruins you spot a camp and it turns out to be human, and friendly. They are rangers from Mazaan Castle (get it, Amazon?), which rules all the lands north of Halden's Wall, which is the wall south of the watermen ruins. A forest troll stole their food, and they ask you to go take him down. The forest troll can't be killed by normal weapons, it's a puzzle, ultimately you kill him with fire. Nice job. The rangers let you know that if you want, they need to give a message to the regent in Audia, from Mazaan. You say yes. The Water Ring makes it quick to get there. 

##Chapter 15
You arrive instantly in Audia, and head to the tavern, and are shocked to find the girl is still alive. She was saved by her father, who was killed in the fire. You decide to settle down in Audia, since they need an armorer. She gives you a ring that they had found on you. The Ring of Light. You have more flashbacks. Of a war. Of a darkness. Of the dead and the dying. A very shady character sees you with the ring. You have to fight him. You win. You give your message to the regent. He says you must escort a dozen of the strongest troops to Mazaan for a special mission. You use the Road in the Rock, and fight off Rock Golems on the way. Your girl tells you she will wait. You get to Mazaan. 

##Chapter 16
Evil is spreading and there are powerful enemies. Northwest of Mazaan is Icefjord, which has been invaded by Snow Trolls. As long as the trolls hold it, snow covers the northern pass and keeps what is left of Mazaan's army from accessing the Thundercrash Bridge.  Which is, of course, the only way to get to the land of Killwraith. There is a war going on. There has just been the largest battle of any race since the dawn of time. Both sides were devestated not just by the loss of their armies, of which almost all of both sides was killed; but both kings were killed as well. Mazaan's King, Henrik, killed the Killwraith in single combat, but Killwraith's son, Eddam, killed the King. It is said that he used a dark evil to draw all the power of the Killwraith into his own soul. Yikes. Well, whatever. You fight the Snow Trolls and the pass is clear. You want to go home. You are ready, but you meet a beautiful girl, the princess of Mazaan. Turns out it is your sister. You used to be the ruler of the ruins that are now the Watermen city. You fought in that crazy battle, you floated over Greatfall and wound up on the banks of Audia. You realize you need to go fight Eddam, he killed your father. Dick. 

#Book V

##Chapter 17
You sleep. You dream. Of a dragon. A sonic dragon, who can scream a pitch so fierce it as if fire burns your brain. (Yep, same dream as before). But you realize it is real. Your army gathers to cross Thundercrash Bridge. You have to fight a ton of Stone Trolls to get through it. You win.

##Chapter 18
You arrive at the graveyard of 200,000 dead. Dark magic has made the land a mire that will last for a thousand yeards. Ghost, Skeletons, Zombies, and Ghouls must be defeated. There is a Lich King that has been raising the dead into this army. When you kill him you hear the sonic scream of the black dragon. It must have been connected somehow to the lich. The lich was keeping as a prison an ancient wizard, he knew your father. Fills in some gaps. And gives you a key, to a house in Audia. He says you can only fight Eddam if get all the rings. You have three so far (Fire, Water, Light), but you need the Ring of Darkness. It's guarded by a Sonic Dragon, but not the one you say already. It's guarded by that dragon's sister. 

##Chapter 19
You go get the ring of darkness. The dragons lair is up in the mountains. It's guarded by elite goblins (since goblins love gold). 

##Chapter 20
With the ring, you now go and face Eddam. The sister dragon joins you to fight her evil brother. You win. You are King. You go to Audia to claim your bride. Victory forever.
