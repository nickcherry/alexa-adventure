# TODO

- break up index.js - one file per request
- add specs for index.js intents
- dynamically load / configure intents based on app
- figure out how to ask follow-up questions (e.g. Are you sure?)
- extract new game, name inquiry, etc. to engine?
- consider commercials
- consider config structure (*everything* should be configurable with json)
- consider requirements / locks
- consider persistence
- consider in-app purchases
- how to ensure that alexa schema/utterances/slots are synced with app code?
